# Computer Systems and Organizations - CS270

Hey there! This repo is all about the fascinating realm of Computer Systems and Organization. In this course, I got to grips with C programming, dived into the nitty-gritty of computer architecture, and wrapped my head around cool stuff like Von Neumann architecture, floating-point arithmetic, memory management, and how things like buffer overflow attack occur, function calls tracing, and some assembly language in Intel x86 CPU !

All the code that is written here is a part of my journey moving from a basic to an intermediate C programmer with an understanding of fundamentals of progamming and modern computer architecture.
